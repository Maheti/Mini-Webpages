                    <b>  ABOUT US</b>
                </h1>
               <p> Make-Up Art Cosmetics started life in Toronto, Canada. Makeup artist and photographer Frank Toskan and salon owner Frank Angelo became frustrated by the lack of makeup that photographed well, so they decided to create their own. At first, they made the cosmetics in their kitchen and sold them straight from the salon to fellow makeup artists, as well as models and photographers.

                   <br><br>Their approach was chic utility, with the makeup coming in black pots rather than compacts. While other major makeup brands at the time were predominantly skincare companies, M路A路C chose instead to establish itself as the ultimate colour authority. Professional makeup artists manned the counter, an industry first.
