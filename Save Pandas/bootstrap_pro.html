          <p  class="text-center">The giant panda is perhaps the most powerful symbol in the world when it comes to species conservation.

              Adored around the world, the distinctive black and white animal is a national treasure in China and has been the symbol of WWF since its formation in 1961.

              While its numbers are slowly increasing, the giant panda remains one of the rarest and most endangered bears in the world.

            <h2 class="text-center"><br>Why should we save the giant panda?</h2>
            <p class="text-justify"><br>We should do everything we can to save the giant panda because we are the ones that have driven it to the edge of extinction. And because we can.

                But pandas also play a crucial role in China's bamboo forests by spreading seeds and helping the vegetation to grow.

              <br><br>  So by saving pandas, we will also be saving so much more. We will be helping to protect not only these unique forests but also the wealth of species that live in them, such as dwarf blue sheep and beautiful multi-coloured pheasants.

                And we will be providing a lifeline for a host of other endangered animals, including the golden snub-nosed monkey, takin and crested ibis that share these magnificent forests with the panda.
